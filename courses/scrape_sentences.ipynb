displayed a hypnotic symmetry of dizzying circles that drew your eyes into the centre as you traced a circle with your foot, lost in a world of its own miniature detail.', \"The artist drew amazing detail in each of the pictures, even capturing the strain and sweat on the football players' faces in the half-time scene.\", 'He was a genuine expert in his field, a historic relic from a golden age

blade with a thin piece of red chalk, he created his message.', 'However, if you looked at each smaller detail, such as the text below each button on the screen, you would notice that they were all slightly blurred, as if the person who created this had very little knowledge of typography.', 'The hall was dark, the only lights coming from the chandelier hanging high above the staircase and the candles in the centerpiece on the long, dark table.', 'The world was drained of detail, all colour sapped from the landscape, everything grey and murky.', 'His gaze flicked over them, not lingering on any particular part of them, instead taking in their general appearance before he dismissed them with a brief nod and a few words before turning back to the man next to him.', 'His pictures were mainly images of trees, buildings, and other various scenes, all captured in exceptional detail.', \"The chef's knife looked strangely out of place in his fat, stubby fingers, the blade edges so sharp you could effortlessly glide a finger across them.\", 'After a moment of observing her work, Jane picked up her magnifying glass to observe the details more clearly.', 'Faintly, he could smell their blood.', 'He read the lines carefully, flicking through the pages with the tips of his fingers, careful not to smudge the coloured inks on each detailed page.', 'Prominently displayed at the corner of every picture frame in the room was some object in black and white, with a vivid yellow smile cut neatly into the center of its face.', 'He gazed in awe at the details of his wall hangings and his jewel encrusted crown.', 'He peered at it intently, hoping to detect some small detail he might have missed.', 'Flicking through the pages, he read through the lines quietly to himself, looking for any small detail he had missed.', 'On one of the shelves sat a row of grey gunpowder canisters, each with a red stamp on them containing a strange serial number and a symbol.', 'Zooming in on the photo, you could just make out the tiny gull perched on a piece of metal railing, its head cocked as if curiously studying you.', 'From where I was sitting at the back of the stands, the faces of the people in the crowd were little more than dots, devoid of any detail.', \"The problem arrived when it came to painting the final layer of detail upon the girl's face.\", 'The whole painting was taken up with pink roses, and careful attention had been paid to the shading of the petals and the veins in the leaves.', 'The artist makes extensive use of detail in his drawings, carefully drawing each hair of his subject.', 'In the top corner of the painting was a small but noticeable detail: a tiny silhouette of a man standing behind a bush.', 'The following is a sentence containing \"shape\":', 'In the dark corner of his eye, he saw a small, shadowy figure creep into the room from under the door.', 'He placed in front of me a glass filled with the tiniest slivers of lemon peel.', 'The carpet was a soft, dove-grey color and a large red dartboard stood off to the side behind the coffee table, next to an old-fashioned wooden record player stacked neatly with vinyl records of old Christmas songs.', 'The artist could paint the most intricate details effortlessly, his career marked by meticulous craftsmanship.', 'I use the finest quality paints and canvas, creating my works with care and attention.', 'The windscreen had a huge crack in it, across the middle, like a giant \"I\".', 'He learned how to produce images full of detail and depth, pictures with a life of their own.', 'The photograph showed a wide road with trees arching above it, on either side, the cherry blossom lining the road, like a flow of white arranged in curves.', 'You could see the tiny goosebumps on his forearms, raised by the penetrating February chill, and the detail of his short, blonde hair.', \"The artists's attention to detail was remarkable, even down to the miniscule stripes on the zebra's legs.\", 'He could not remember ever having seen such a masterpiece of technical detail, every section of the imperial fleet was there, perfect in every last detail.', 'Detail is important to an author.', \"The entire image was fuzzy, as if she hadn't focused the lens properly.\", 'It was a simple design, yet every curve, every line of the framework spoke of centuries of meticulous craftsmanship, lovingly dedicated to detail.', '#obvious', '\"You\\'re not seriously even considering giving him the part?\" she asked in an equally obvious attempt to lengthen her tresses.', \"I
