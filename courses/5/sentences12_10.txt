# damp


The basement was dark and damp. The floor was wet. A man sat by himself there. He had a black hoodie over his head, and he wore no shoes. His face was covered in dirt and grime.


The cellar is dark and damp. A man sits there, staring at his feet. He has a small lantern in his hand. His face is dirty and scruffy. He looks like he's been here a while.


I shivered as the damp cold air nipped at my skin. The wind blew, and the snowflakes fell from the sky.


The soft dirt in the floor of the cave was damp and ankle-deep. The earth was smooth and warm under my feet. A small stream flowed beside the cave mouth.


The tunnel was damp and smelled of wet soil. I walked along it. It led deeper into the earth. A few feet away from me, there was a stone wall. I could see nothing but darkness beyond that wall.


I could feel the damp ground under my feet. A dog barked. I walked up to the house. It smelled like rain and dirt. The door opened, and there stood a man with his hands in his pockets. He wore a dark suit that covered him from head to toe.


The earth was damp from the regular rain. I saw a small stream that flowed through the grass. It was very quiet there.


The cave walls were damp and wet to the touch. They were covered with mosses and plants. A small stream flowed from one side of the cave to another. I stood under the waterfall, looking up at the ceiling.


The basement was dark and damp. The walls were covered with cobwebs. I sat by the window and watched the rain pour down. The sky was gray and rainy.


The ground was damp everywhere and I could feel the dirt slowly give way. A black dog barked at something behind me. I turned around to see what it was barking about.


It was a cool, damp cave. A man sat in the middle of the cave. He had a black beard and wore a cloak over his shoulders. The fire reflected in his eyes.




# leap


The kitten leapt onto the chair across from me. It curled up into a bundle of fur. It lay still. It gazed at me with big, green eyes. They were beautiful and bright.


The hare leapt through the moonlight. Its eyes shone like stars. It ran across the field. I watched as it disappeared from sight.


He could leap over the fence in a single bound. He jumped over the fence and disappeared.


The deer leapt gracefully over the fallen tree. It ran along the road. It was so fast I barely had a good look before it disappeared.


The cat leapt over the fence into the yard. It jumped up onto the porch. It walked around the house and into the backyard. It sat on top of a tree stump and stared out across the yard.


The leopard leapt from its hiding place. It took a quick look around before leaping out of sight.


The deer jumped across the brook in a single leap. She ran fast, but then slowed. Then she stopped. She turned her head and stared at me. Her eyes were blue and green, like mine.


The frog leapt through the grass. It had a green skin and big eyes. Its legs were long and skinny. I watched it jump through the grass.


The hare leapt out of the hole. It ran along the road. I saw it jump over the fence. I followed it until it disappeared from sight.




# grasp


I grasped his hand as tightly as I could. He held onto me tight. We walked together for hours. I asked him questions about everything he knew. His eyes sparkled when he answered them.


He looked like he was grasping something in his hand, but I couldn't tell what it was. He stood there for a moment, looking at me. Then he disappeared.


I had to grasp the rope with all my strength. My fingers hurt. I tried to pull myself up, but I couldn't move. The rope was too heavy for me to lift up.

I reached out to grasp the butterfly, but it flew away. I grabbed for it again, but it was gone. My fingers clutched nothing but air.

I reached out and grasped my little sister's hand. She had been crying for her mother. I held her hand tightly, and we walked home together.

I reached out to grasp his arm, but he pulled it away. He turned around and walked away.

The books on the top shelf were beyond my grasp. They were heavy, and I could not lift them up. I had to ask my brother to help me reach.


Success lay within her grasp as she approached the finish line. She had been running for hours, but she knew that the end was near. Her legs felt weak and heavy but she made it to the finish line.


# scatter


The leaves scattered in the wind. They fell from the trees like snowflakes. I saw them falling. My eyes closed, and I slept.


Before my eyes, the bunnies scattered and hopped away. They jumped over the fence and ran across the road. I watched them run until they disappeared from sight.


Before my eyes, the pile of blossoms scattered into the air. They fell like snowflakes. My mother sat by them, smiling. She held me close to her chest. Her smile was sweet and warm.

His belongings were scattered all over the floor. His clothes were torn. He had no shoes. I watched him walk around the room. He walked past his desk, and sat on the chair next to it.


The leaves scattered down around us. They were green, and they fell from the trees. The wind blew them about. The sun shone brightly upon the grasses, which had yellow flowers.


The wind blew through the trees, scattering golden leaves everywhere. I saw the sun rise from behind the mountains. It was beautiful.


The scattered flowers reminded me of spring. They were wild and beautiful. I wanted to see them all.


The farmer scattered the seeds all over the ground. He had a big garden. He planted some peas, and carrots, and corn, then he watered them before heading back to sleep.

I felt the pebbles scatter under my feet as I ran. They hurt a lot, but they didn't slow me down. I couldn't see anything, but I knew that I had to keep running.


The children's toys scattered all over the room. They were not very big, but they were cute. Most of them were dolls. I wanted them all.


It was a beautiful display of scattered stars against the velvet backdrop of the night sky. I stared at them for hours. They seemed so far away from here.






# dose


The dose of medicine cured Grandma's cold. She no longer had a cough and could walk around the house again.


The doctor gave the patient a dose of sleeping pills. He said he wanted to make sure that the man slept well.


You need to take a dose of penicillin to combat the infection. It will take a few days for you to recover, but you will be fine.


I took a dose of the sleeping medicine before bed. I slept for hours. When I woke up, I saw that it was already afternoon.

Jake took a dose of his cold medicine before bed. He slept soundly until morning. Then he woke up, and had a great appetite. He ate some bacon and eggs, and felt a lot better.


# strain

I strained to see something in the darkness. A light shone from above. I saw a bright star, shining brightly. It was cloudy, and there was no moon tonight.

I strained to hear sounds outside my tent, but nothing could be heard. I sat up from my sleeping bag. I watched the stars come out. They were beautiful.

I strain to hear a sound, but there is only silence. I am lost in the darkness.

I strained my ears to hear any sounds of movement. A light breeze blew. I could not see anything, but I knew there was something out there. Something was calling to me.


I strained my ears to hear any sounds of movement. A few seconds later, I heard something. It sounded like a voice.

Steel cables holding up bridges are constantly under a lot of strain.The storm was so bad that it caused one cable to snap.


Too much time spent looking at the computer will strain the eyes. You should have a rest once in a while.


He strained his back while moving the chair. Now he has to spend a few days in bed to recover.


He strained a muscle in his leg. He was running a long race when it happened.


# trail


We went walking on a mountain trail for the day. The route offered great views. I saw a flock of blackbirds flying overhead. They were so pretty, they made me feel happy.

There was a trail of stones that showed the way. They led to a cave. A light shone inside the cave. The sun was shining brightly, but it seemed cold.


A trail of smoke leads to the campfire. A man is sitting by the fire. He has long hair that falls past his shoulders. He was holding a piece of meat over the fire to cook.


A trail of smoke drifted lazily into the sky. A fire burned in the fireplace. The flames danced around the hearth. I watched them for hours.


We tried to follow the hiking trail, but we got lost. We wandered for hours. Eventually, we found a small stream that led us back to the village.


The trail in the woods led to a dark cave. I could hear the sound of water inside. I followed the trail. The sound came from a small waterfall in the cave.


The trail to the old well is easy to spot. You can see it from your house. If you walk along the road, you will find that there are two paths leading to the well. One path leads up the hillside; the other goes around behind your house.


I love walking up the trail to the hills at the edge of our property. We have been here for years, but we haven't gone too far from the house yet. I can see the mountains from here. They are high and majestic.


I love walking along the trail and picking up shells. They are so pretty. Sometimes, I think about how I can make them into things. Maybe a bracelet, or a necklace.


The trail to the campsite was easy to follow. The sun was shining brightly. I followed the trail until it led me to the campsite. There were many people there, eating dinner. They all seemed happy and contented.


The trail twisted and turned as it made its way up the mountain. I followed it. As we climbed higher, the trail became more difficult to follow. We had no idea what lay ahead of us.


We followed the campers' trail and wound through the woods. We walked along the path for hours. The sun was hot, but we did not care. A light breeze blew, and we could smell the earthy scent of grasses and flowers.

# awful

It was an awful noise that sounded like fingernails on a chalkboard. I thought it was a horrible sound, but did not know what caused. I tried searching but could not find it.

The professor's awful theory got a big laugh from the class. He said that the world was flat. If you sailed to the edge, you would fall.

The monster had an awful smell. I wanted to get away from it. It smelled like rotten meat and blood. I screamed when I saw it.


The movie was really awful. The actor did not put on a good performance. He was a little scary. The audience booed him.


I did awfully in the test because I didn't revise hard enough. I got B's in all my classes. My teacher told me that if I worked harder, then I could get A's.

I had an awful day at school, I forgot to bring my books and the teacher told me off. Luckily my friend said we could share. That made me feel a little better.


I had to walk to school in the rain. It was awful. The rain was cold. I could hear the thunder. I saw a lightning flash in the sky.


I didn't sleep well and woke up with an awful headache. I felt like I had been hit by a truck. My head hurt so bad that I couldn't see straight. The pain was getting worse.


# regret


I regret that I didn't go on the trip. The weather was much better than expected, and everyone who went had a lovely time.


I have always had regret about how things ended up. I think about what could've been. What would've happened if I'd listened to you?


I regret that I didn't accept Ryan's invitation to the movies. I should have gone. He said he'd take me to see "The Wizard of Oz." I was too lazy to get up and just watched TV in bed..


I regret how I left without saying goodbye. I will never forget you. You are always in my heart.


James regretted not studying harder when he realized the test was today. He should have studied more. There was plenty of time to do it.


It made me feel regret for what I had done. I wished that I could change things, but it was too late.


We regret the terrible mistake we made. If we were more careful it could have been avoided. We are sorry for what happened.


It made me feel regret for what I had done. I wanted to go back home. I wanted to run away from this place.


I regretted taking the trip and wanted to go home. Traveling was a lot more expensive than I expected, and I could not afford to visit the museum I wanted to go to.


I regret the mistakes that I made in the past. I wish I could go back and change them. However I can’t, so I will have to try and be better in the future.


I regret that I hadn't spent more time in the bookstore. Now it's closed and I can't go anymore. I will have to go to the library instead.


I regretted eating that burger, it was too big and I now feel sick. I had a headache all day today.


I regret my decision to go through the caves alone, it was too scary. The cave was dark, and cold.  I wish that someone had come along with me.

# barrier

There was a huge barrier of dead branches piled in the center of the road. They were all broken, twisted, and bent. It was impossible to drive over them. I had to take a detour through the fields.

A six foot barrier of tangled, overgrown brambles lay between me and the house. I could not climb over it. There was a gate somewhere, but I looked for a long time and could not find it.

The workers helped build barriers to prevent the town from being flooded. They were very nice people, and the villagers were very grateful for what they had done.

He tried to jump the barrier at a concert and run on stage, but security guards took him away. They asked him to leave the concert and was not allowed to come back.


The barrier of trees stopped us from advancing deeper into the woods. There was no way round, so we had to turn back. It was getting dark, and we wanted to be home before it got too cold.


Concrete barriers surround the race track to protect spectators. They are built to keep people from getting hurt. It has to be strong, because sometimes a driver loses control of the car during a race and crashes into the wall.


They put up a tall barrier around the new house. This was to stop people from walking onto the building site accidentally and getting hurt.


At the end of the alley, a barrier of crates and trash bags blocked my way. I thought it was a shortcut but had to turn around. The smell was really bad too.


Over time the tall weeds and hedges formed a natural barrier between the two farms. This was very helpful because it stopped sheep from wandering to the neighbouring farm.


There's a barrier of trees blocking your view of the sky. If you want to have a better view through this window, you will have to ask someone to cut down the trees.


The trees made a barrier around the house and there was no way over the fence. There was no way of climbing in. This made the house very safe because thieves were not able to get in.


The mountain was the last barrier between the travellers and their destination. The mountains were tall and steep, but there was a rocky path on the mountainside. It took two days for them to cross but the made it.

# limp

The dying flower was limp in my hand. Its petals were red and its stem was green. I thought it was beautiful and took it home with me.

Her clothes were soaked, and her hair hung limp above her shoulders. She was cold and did not look happy. I quickly let her into the house and told her to have a hot shower.

The old book had a limp binding and was close to falling apart. I picked it up. I read a story about a boy who loved his dog more than anything else. He could not get enough of the little creature. 

The flowers in the vase on the mantle were sadly limp. They had been placed there by Grandma. She always said they were very pretty. I picked some petals and made a pretty necklace for her.

When he fell asleep, his legs went soft and limp. He slept for a long time, and had lots of dreams about football.

# chore

I hate doing the chores. I wish they'd just let me play all day. My mom always said that if I wanted to play, then I should do my work first. It made me grumpy but I had no choice.


My least favourite chore is doing the dishes. I hate doing them. They are dirty and messy. I preferred to do the laundry. The smell of freshly washed linen was a lot nicer.


Before going to bed, I have to do chores. I have to sweep the floor, wash dishes, and clean up around the house. It took a long time but I wanted to help my mom.


After I finish my chores, I am allowed to play outside. I love playing outside. I like to go for walks with my dog and play fetch in the fields. We always stayed until it was dark.


I had to do my chores before I watched TV. I was given the choice of washing the dishes or cleaning the floor. I chose to mop the floor because it was quicker. 


My least favourite chore is cleaning my room. I had to do it though, because everyone cleaned their own rooms. If I didn’t then it would get too dirty to live in.


We have no more chores to do today, so we can go play now. We will go play in the garden. Mom said that we could play there all day if we wanted.


I agreed to do the chores for my brother for a week. In exchange, he gave me his toy car for the week. I thought it was a good deal!

# insane

The insane look in his eyes made me shudder. He stared at me and didn’t blink. His skin was white as snow. He had long black hair that fell past his shoulders.


The man was moved into an insane asylum for mentally ill people. He lived there for years. His name was Frank, but everyone called him "the madman." Everyone said he was crazy.


You're insane if you think I'm going to go play in the rain. Why would I go outside when it’s nice and comfortable indoors? We could play a boardgame or read.


The teacher laughed so loudly I thought he might be insane! He stopped speaking in class sometimes and just laughed and laughed. My friends were scared of him.

# demolish

The wrecking ball was used to demolish the old building. It had been there for years. My grandfather told me about it. He said that if you went up to the top of the building, you could see the whole city.


It took them only a few hours to demolish the house. They used some explosives to blow up the walls, then they cleared the rubble using bulldozers.


His car was demolished in the accident. He had to buy a new car. Luckily the insurance company paid, and he was happy with the replacement. It was much nicer than his old car.


Her chances of becoming mayor were demolished by the scandal she was involved in. She lost her job, and had to move out of town. As a result her opponent had an easy victory and became mayor.


They demolished the old theatre and built a parking lot. Many people complained about the loss, but the theatre was close to falling down anyways.


Your little brother stepped on your model city and demolished it again. You should have kept it on a table where he could not reach. Next time you should be more careful about where you leave you things.


I was so hungry I demolished my meal in the blink of an eye. I ate a burger, fries and a piece of cake. Afterwards I was full I almost couldn’t walk!
