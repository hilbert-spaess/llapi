Reading Comprehension Paragraph 1 (Boats)

Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats. House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. Lighters are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Mammoths)

Carnivores that once roamed North America and Europe are now extinct in those regions as well. The last mammoth died out about 10,000 years ago. Other large herbivores that evolved in North America and reached giant proportions included the mastodon. The first humans to enter North America from Asia hunted and roamed alongside these giants.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 1 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Acids)

Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) are an important component of many biological systems. They serve as buffers against acidity, help maintain cell membranes and play a role in the synthesis of proteins. Bicarbonate also serves as an intermediate transfer of carbon during the fixation and respiration of carbon. In soft drinks such as Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper, bicarbonate is used as a flavouring. It is an essential part of the buffering system, without which these drinks would taste very different, if they even had the same taste at all.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 4 (Honey bees)

Apis is a genus of several species of honey bees, with only the honey bee, Apis mellifera, being economically important.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Albinos)

Babies born with white skin are albino. Albinism is a condition where the body produces less melanin than normal, resulting in pale skin, hairlessness or very light colored eyes. If both parents are albinos, there is a good chance the offspring will also be an albino. If one or both carry a normal gene, the odds decrease accordingly. Albino animals and plants are rare as the trait doesn't offer any advantages. They don't hide as well or attract mates as easily. Diseases affect them as much as other creatures.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Abacuses)

Mammals that have been domesticated for food production include cattle, goats, sheep and pigs. The term abacus comes from the Latin word acies, meaning "cow", while the Spanish word abaca means cowpea plant. Arithmetic is a vital element of everyday life in many human societies, and abacuses are used to perform simple calculations. Abracas are mostly used in business settings where most calculations can be made with recourse to pencil and paper for calculations requiring more than what the abacus itself can provide. The same cultural vein that relied upon the abacus now uses domestic computing.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Abattoirs)

Poultry farming is the process of raising poultry for food, mainly through selective breeding and keeping them in large industrial facilities. The industry has been increasing worldwide since World War II due to the increased demand for meat in developed countries. In the UK, the rise in poultry production is due in large part to reduction in the amount of grazing land available for cattle. The meat (called "chicken" for whole birds and "chicken meat" for the meat only), eggs and feathers of poultry, such as chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys, have been used for human consumption since ancient times.
While commercial egg-laying operations existed in the U.S.

1 The Great Barrier Reef was named after Sir John Ross Macquarie who discovered it in 1788.
The large letter M on the map were the first markings of the massive coral reef, which is located in the ocean to the north of Australia. The markings were made in 1822 by a famous English explorer and surveyor, Matthew Flinders. Twenty-eight years later, in 1850, a man sailed over the edge, or off the edge of this same reef to be more accurate. The English explorer and navigator, Captain Matthew Webb, was the first man known to have swum over the Great Barrier Reef. History was made!

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Aberrations)

Oddities: The anomalous is defined as something that does not fit into any other category. For example, the anomalous animal is a creature that has no known natural predators; it can only survive due to its unique characteristics. Most known examples of the anomalous animal are fishes, such as the Opah (Lampris gutattus).

In 1880, a living fossil was found in Austria; it is called the Wolperting animal. This creature looks like a cross between a cat and a weasel. It is active during the night, hunting around trees and bushes for small prey. It is a very elusive animal and it was not until 1883 when a scientist was able to catch one. It has not been seen since, leading people to believe they went extinct.

Travellers from Australia, New Zealand and other parts of Oceania have traditionally been known as Aborigines.

Today, most anthropologists accept the term "Aborigine" as accurate when speaking of Austronesian people indigenous to mainland Australia and nearby islands within Oceania, using native inhabitants of the whole continent. The traditional tribal names are the most commonly used terms. The word "Aborigine" is sometimes used to refer to the indigenous peoples in regions outside Australia, but within Oceania. In the English language, aborigine an anglicised derivative of the Latin word is classified as acceptable by the Oxford English Dictionary.

Fetal abnormalities are rare in humans, but they can occur in individuals with certain genetic disorders. These include Down syndrome, trisomy 21 and Patau syndromes. The presence of the sexual cells (eggs and sperms) are genetic enough for these conditions to happen, but they can also be brought upon by a variety of other factors, including lifestyle. Congenital abnormalities that are acquired e.g. alcohol (flooded brain) or chemicals (cleft lip) during the pregnancy may also occur. These leaves the embryo and fetus in distress. In other words, it must be done away with, usually through an abortion.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 1 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Absences)

Habits, rituals and customs associated with religious observances are not common in the human population, but they do occur among certain groups of people. The practice of Vodou is one such religion. It is most popular in areas once dominated by the former French colony of Saint-Domingue, including the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique and Haiti. The religious beliefs of this faith involve many different gods and spirits, in a fashion that is reminiscent of the Roman tradition. These beings must be appeased through a variety of rituals in order to achieve the favor that they might provide for the follower.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Absentees)

Mental Absence Syndrome (M.E.) is a condition where individuals experience symptoms after having been absent from a place for prolonged periods of time, usually lasting days to weeks. The symptoms can include confusion, disorientation and hallucinations. The symptoms are often compared to the likes of nervous exhaustion, neurasthenia and difficulty in re-adaptation to a situation or environment. Causes of the condition are still relatively unknown and are subject to many hypotheses, ranging from sensory deprivation to re-integration issues of identity and memory.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Abstinences)

Nuts and berries are plants that contain seeds, nuts and other edible parts. The term 'abstemious' refers to individuals who eat only foods that do not require preparation prior to consumption. Tribes and societies that engage in the consumption of these plants are often referred to as 'abstinent'.
Common 'abstemious' foods include: fruit, vegetables, edible roots and fungis. Some abstinent tribes and societies also consume particular animal meats as well.
It is commonly accepted that too much consumption of berries and nuts can lead to malnutrition, or allergic reactions in some individuals. Most tribes and societies that engage in the consumption of nuts and berries also practice the consumption of other types of food as well.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Abundances)

Growth rates vary widely among organisms. The rate at which a given organism grows depends upon many factors including: the environment it lives in; how much food it eats; what drugs or chemicals it absorbs from its surroundings; and so forth. The growth rate of a given organism changes as it grows, for example, the brain size of human baby doubles about every 74 days and then slows down.

Growth or decline of an organism's population is a function of two factors: #1)the birth rate of individuals in that population, and #2)that population's loss of individuals from the environment it exists in. If the environment changes, then the population's growth may or may not steadily continue through time.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Abuses)

Dogs have been domesticated since ancient times. The first known dogs were brought from Persia around 5000 BC, but it was not until around 4000 BC that they became widespread throughout the Middle East and Europe. Tribes such as the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans kept dogs primarily for hunting and for war. In fact, it is in these countries that dog breeds with particular traits were first developed. However, it was not until the 19th century that wealthy Americans and Europeans began to keep dogs for companionship rather than utility. This created a booming market in dog breeding.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Abysses)

Eyes are the windows through which we see the world around us. They also provide a window into our minds. Eyes are sensitive to light, which is why when it is dark, we complain of our eyes hurting. There is not as much light. Our pupils act like the aperture of a camera lens. In the case of animals like dogs and cats, the aperture automatically adjusts to the amount of light. In our case, we have to move the aperture, or the iris, ourselves. When it is dark, our pupils shrink so that less light enters our eyes. When it is light outside, our pupils expand so that light can enter.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Academias)

Lacking any specific word to describe the structures, the term "academy" has been used to refer to any place where learning takes place. The term "college" gained implied university connotations since university moved into the higher education. Many later college students experience collegiality, and the literal meaning of the word refers to a non-hierarchical social environment between students and teachers. As there are many types of schools in various places, strictly speaking, it is impossible to precisely characterize a standard collegiate atmosphere. In this respect, each school has its own distinctive personality.

A university is a place where learning takes place through teaching, research and other activities. Universities are often run by professional staff who have degrees from recognised institutions. The term "university" is used worldwide to refer to higher education institutions specializing in teaching and research, and which are generally not schools providing further education. In some countries, the term is also used to refer to institutions of intermediate and advanced learning, which are not universities but sometimes have legal rights to use English or a foreign language for instruction.

UFOs are unidentified flying objects or UFOs. They have been reported in all parts of the world, from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica. UFOs are reported to National UFO Reporting Center in the US monthly. UFOs are a type of UAS or Unidentified Aerial Sighting and there are some key differences between the two as follows:
Most UFOs are reported by more than one person, or with independent evidence such as radar returns or video footage. With the exception of photos, videos and audio recordings, UASs can be reported by a single person.
Non-human builders or alien creatures are not believed to make most UFOs, but it can't be ruled out.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Accents)

I've always been fascinated by accents. I think it's because I grew up in a place where people spoke different languages and had different dialects, so there was something very interesting about learning another language that you couldn't understand. I was raised bilingually, so even when I was little, I used to play a game called 'language exchange' where I would ask a friend to teach me some of their words and then teach them some of mine. I took it even further by watching US television shows with subtitles and trying to read the words out loud to myself as I was reading them. It was fun to sound out the words and try to find patterns of similar sounds in my own language. I didn't realise that I was doing phonics, which are the basis for teaching children to read. It is interesting how we shinmelearn things in different ways.

Sailors are required to have at least one acceptance letter from a port of call abroad prior to departure. This document lists all the ports of call along with details such as dates, time and duration of each visit. The ultimate responsibility for an 'acceptable' list belonging to a passenger rests with the ship's master. Certain other maritime authorities such as pilots are also required to submit an acceptance letter to the captain of a ship they are visiting. A single sea pass may only be used by one person and it's acceptable only for the time period mentioned in it.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Accesses)

Rivers, canals and other navigable waterways are also known as waterways. The term "navigable" refers to the fact that it is possible for vessels to pass through them without difficulty. Though the term "moat" is sometimes used interchangeably with "canal", and a canal may have a moat, a water-filled moat makes a castle more difficult to attack. In medieval England and Europe, castles were often built with moats around them. Later on these were replaced with wide ornamental stone walls; nowadays, the moat has become decorative and provides landscaping to the castle or mansion.

An airplane is a flying machine that uses air pressure rather than wings to provide lift. There are different types, or categories, of airplanes. A fixed-wing aircraft has wings that do not move; a rotorcraft has wings that rotate, and an airship uses an airborne gas for lift. A tiltrotor aircraft has wings that can change angle position from vertical to horizontal. A lighter-than-air airship has a large bag of lifting gas such as helium to provide lift, or on smaller ones, the lift is created by the difference between internal and external air pressure.

It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called @boats@.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Acclaims)

Una acción is Spanish for "newly born". Accions are small wooden boxes that contain various items such as candles, matches, tobacco, salt and sugar. They are particularly popular throughout Spain, mainly in Galicia and the Basque region. The tradition of giving accions as gifts on Three Kings Day is common throughout Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia and some regions of Extremadura. They are usually given to young children on the festive night. The content is not the only difference among accions, but also what kind of wood they re made from and the design of the clasp.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Accolades)

Sixty-four Years Old: The Last Man Standing!

When the last man standing wins a major sporting event, it usually means that he has proven himself superior to his opponents. Even under the harshest of circumstances, he has been able to survive and thrive. The same holds true in business. When you can lead a company to victory in a declining industry it is something to be proud of!

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Accommodations)

Housing is one of the major factors that influence how well a society functions. A society can have a high standard of living due to its wealth and luxury goods, but if it lacks adequate housing facilities then it will struggle to function effectively. This was a major issue in late Imperial Rome where there was a extensive lack of affordable housing for its citizens.

The wealthy owned large houses with multiple storeys and often interior courtyards. The growing middle classes struggled in the high rents charged by the landowners and rich proprietors. The working classes, who rarely owned their own house, occupied apartment blocks in insanitary and dangerous conditions. A common feature of Roman towns in cities was insulae or apartment blocks.

Efforts have been made to make this list more comprehensive, but the following achievements are considered essential:

1. The first successful manned flight by an animal was performed by Charles Lindbergh on December 7, 1927. From a nearby airfield San Diego, California, the United States navy aircraft carrier, the USS Lexington, conducted an experiment to research the possibility of using aircraft carriers for aviation. A package of cloth weighing 1.8 kg and labeled as "Sheep No 610" was placed in a wicker basket. A tent and a bottle-fed lamb, which they had named "Dixie Lucky" was placed in the wicker basket as well. This package was placed in a second wicker basket and towed about 3 meters behind the Spirit of St. Louis. This was the first time an animal had flown in an airplane though the sheep died after landing.

Laws of nature are laws that govern natural phenomena. They can be considered absolute, relative or conditional. Laws of nature include gravity, electromagnetism and thermodynamics. Some fields, like biochemistry and entomology, have set laws that govern them; however there are no laws that apply to every field. Many, but not all, concepts in philosophy are law-like. The natural sciences may be classed as the study of objects that obey laws of nature.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Accordions)

Rising from the 17th century, accordions were invented in France during the early 18th century. They have been used ever since to make music by varying the speed of strings at different points along a string. Concertinas are a closely related instrument, which use buttons instead of keys in order to make a different note. They are written music in treble or bass clef, but sound an octave higher as they are overblown. Concertinas are usually used in Irish music, but are becoming more popular in contemporary music.
The bandoneon is a type of concertina that is primarily used in tango music.

Routines are systematic procedures used to accomplish tasks efficiently. They may involve carrying out one action repeatedly until it has been achieved, or they may involve making a series of decisions that result in the same outcome being reached. There are many kinds of routines. A person's choice of morning routine might begin with brushing hair, followed by showering and then by selecting clothing items. A person may perform this series of actions every morning or may omit one or more of these actions on occasion, but there is some predictability to the choice of actions. The rest of the person's day may be less predictable, but decisions about showering and clothing still follow routines.

Tables of accounting information are used for recording transactions and keeping accounts. The various columns represent different kinds of financial instruments, including cash balances, receivables, assets and liabilities. The rows represent different kinds of financial transactions, including the buying, selling and exchanging of various kinds of goods and services. Each row is analysed to generate a figure that is then entered across the row in an adjacent column. This process is known as "tabularisation". The tables are often part of a larger book, or series of books, that contain more detailed information about the types of assets and liabilities as well as notes on accounting theory.

However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Accusations)

Hindsight is 20/20, but if you had to make one choice now about what you would have done differently in your relationship with her, would it be different? Would you still be together?

You look at her face. Her expression is strained, as she tries to suppress any gut reaction that might be a tell for her cards.

Slowly, you realize that there was no question that needed answering.

You were already part of a conspiracy to defraud her father by using his identity to open bank accounts. You didn't need more reasons. How many did you need?

Your heart is beating faster as the adrenaline floods your system. The question changed everything, and now she knows she can trust you.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Acids)

Gases are liquids that contain one or more atoms of a single element, such as hydrogen or carbon dioxide. Most gases have a boiling point below absolute zero (-273°C), while some have a freezing point above absolute zero (-459°C). Gases are less dense than air and thus may tend to rise, and can be a broad category of large group of related molecules of varying polarities, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide.
All compounds that can release gaseous particles into the atmosphere are called gases. This process, like combustion, release the bond between the gas and the other element and breakup the single compound into two or more elements.

Iodine gas is a colorless, odorless, tasteless liquid that occurs naturally in the earth and atmospheric air. The presence of iodine gas produces a yellowish glow under certain conditions. The element is also found in the form of iodides and iodates. Iodine obtained from iodine gas has variable properties that depend on variables such as particle size, cooling procedures and purification processes. Iodine gas is sometimes used in medical applications.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Acnes)

Hair follicles produce oil that lubricates hair roots and acts as a natural moisturizer. When these oils accumulate in the scalp, it can cause dandruff, oily skin and even eczema. Excessive sebum production is often caused by the overproduction of sebaceous glands, which are influenced by various factors such as age, pregnancy, menopause, menstruation, birth control pills and stress. These glands are also affected by external factors such as pollution, weather and contact with chemicals. Antibiotics can also cause the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. Excessive sebum production is often associated with the development of acne in sensitive skin types.

Mentioning someone's name in conversation can often lead to more than just a friendly hello; it may also result in a pleasant exchange of information. Small talk about a mutual acquaintance is a great topic to help start up a conversation. If you're looking to meet people of similar interests, it helps to talk about your mutual friends or acquaintances. If someone mentions a person you know while in conversation with you, do not hesitate to ask the person about their acquaintance. However, if you are both acquaintances of this person and bring him or herself up in conversation, it is wise to find something positive to say.

Selling an anomalous item can result in considerable profit, but it also carries certain risks. For example, if you sell something that turns out to be a fake, you may lose all your money. Criminal gangs and unscrupulous people can also make a lot of money from unsuspecting customers. If an item is acquired fraudulently, then there may be implications for the seller, in some cases even affecting unrelated third parties.

Some foundations may be willing to pay large sums of money for particularly valuable items. It may be possible to acquire such items with creative methods. Other items might need to be repurposed in some way before they are useful for acquisition purposes.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Acrobats)

Roughly translated from Greek, acrobatic means "to perform without any previous training" and ballet refers to dance. Hence, acrobatic ballet consists of dancing and performing highly athletic moves involving the body's centre of gravity. This could include head stands, flying aerials, turning flips and so on. Contrary to popular belief, it does not necessarily involve standing on one's hands and feet, although finger stands are sometimes demonstrated in the opening sequences of aerial performances. Acrobatic ballet may also involve the ballet dancer crossing their legs behind their head so that only their feet are touching, and this position is sometimes called a bottie, or in Russian it is called pokaz klouna.

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Acrylics)

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so it follows that if you can imitate something well enough, then people will want to look at what you have to offer. That's why we all love acrylic paintings. It's also the reason why acrylic paint has overtaken oils for some artists. Much like the pigment itself, acrylic painters come in all forms. There are some who produce hyper-realistic paintings for others to hang on their wall. Others go the abstract route, creating optical illusions that would otherwise trick the mind if seen in person. Still more enjoy creating bright, cheerful paintings meant to entertain the viewer and provide something cheery to the home or office of some appreciative patron.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Actions)

Gravity is the force that keeps objects from falling through space and maintaining the Earth's surface. The Sun is said to have formed because a massive star collapsed under its own gravity and merged with another nearby star.

Gravitational mass is an object's tendency to attract other objects with gravitational force. The gravitational constant, denoted by the letter G, is the object's measurement of gravity. In the international system of units (SI), the unit of measurement for mass is the kilogram, and the unit of measurement for gravitational force is m/s2.

This is different from the electromagnetic force, which is caused by objects' electrical charges, denoted by the letter Q, and measured in newtons.

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called @boats@.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Addictions)

Cannabis: The plant Cannabis sativa L., commonly known as marijuana, has been used medicinally for centuries. The main active ingredient of cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is a cannabinoid that activates specific receptors in the brain. The receptors have been known as cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2). When THC is taken intravenously, it enters the blood brain barrier and creates psychoactive effects. Long-term use of THC can lead to addiction; in one study conducted in New Zealand, approximately 10% of those who use cannabis become dependent.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Additives)

Urine contains more than just water, it also has chemicals called urea that are converted into ammonia in your body. The higher concentration of these compounds means you have to drink a lot less to produce the same amount of urine. This makes sense since the ammonia helps flush out toxins from your system. However, when combined with other drugs, this can lead to increased risks of overdose or even death. This has helped create a stereotype that those who use are "druggies" or "junkies" who don't even care about their own survival and risk it with highly dangerous mixtures. However, while users do sometimes purposely mix drugs due to a lack of money or access to a particular drug, equally there are a significant amount of cases where one drug is unknown, such as in a batch or even due to a false positive.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Addresses)

Formal addresses are used when sending letters, postcards, or other written communications. They may also be used for personal correspondence. Informal addresses can refer to one's residence, workplace, or any place where one usually resides. There are several professional and semi-formal business letter formats, including the block, continental, and a number of other less common styles. They should be written with correct spelling and grammar, and the address on the envelope should be as legible as possible.

Some formal business letters include the complimentary closing, which may be included as part of the letter's address. It is considered bad form to begin a letter with this closing. Other elements that should be written correctly are the date and signature.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Addresses)

Cities are made up of multiple buildings that together make up a city block. A street is a narrow strip of land between two buildings. The word 'street' comes from the Latin stercorium, meaning 'stairway'. In urban areas, streets function as areas for people to walk. Most streets are paved, some are unpaved.The paved streets are easier to keep clean and free of rubbish than the unpaved streets. Because many streets are paved, people do not have to worry as much about injuring their feet. Some streets have trees planted in wide containers (planting strips) between the sidewalk and road.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 4 (Food)

Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown foodstuff, made from the crushed seeds or beans of the cacao tree.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Adjustments)

Growth: The growth rate of any organism depends upon the amount of energy available. When there is more food available, the body grows faster than when less food is available. This phenomenon is known as "food availability". The main energy for any organism, whether unicellular or multicellular is "carbohydrate". The term "energy" is related to the amount of carbohydrate that is seen in the body. The higher the energy, the greater the rate of growth.

Breathing: All animal respiration involves oxygen. Molecules called "enzymes" act as tiny machines. These enzymes speed up the rate of reaction and make it more efficient.

History

Your name is Ian and you work for a company called Blue Moon Games. It's only a small office, but it's fulfilling enough that you don't really mind so much. There's not many people that work in Blue Moon, let alone that you see every day. It's more along the lines of a few employees spread out across the office, with yourself being one of them. Each of you is usually assigned to different projects, which can range anything from website design to application development.

The more you think about it though, the less sense it makes that you're actually part of a video game company...

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Administrations)

I'm not sure what you mean by "administrations", but I don't think it involves running around naked in a forest. After years of scientific research, it appears that the human brain, or indeed the brain of most intelligent animals, has a limited amount of administrative processing power. Once this power limit has been reached, additional input will caused the brain to begin rejecting input. For humans this is sometimes visible externally as a state of zen-like focus or deep meditative trance. For most animals, it usually involves something much simpler such as playing with toes or rolling around on grass.

Many of these sailors and explorers were adventurous men and women who left their homelands to start a new life out on the seas. Many people admired these seafarers for their travels and conquests. On the other hand, many others despised these adventurers for their religious beliefs, claims to lands and deceitful tactics.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 1 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Ados)

Named after the Aztec god of death, Adonis, this word means "life" in Mayan. The adobo bean is a plant native to Mexico that has been used as food for thousands of years. This legume grows well in adverse weather conditions such as frost or drought. As food writer Patricia Quintana explains, it is important to cook the bean well, "until its skin starts cracking."

Adobo is used extensively in Mexican cooking for marinating and seasoning meat, fish or other vegetables. Every cook has his or her own recipe and technique for preparing Adobo. The main idea is to soak dried Adobo beans, grind them, soak them again and then cook them for about eight hours. Refined sugar is added towards the end of cooking.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Adolescences)

Grown adults usually reach maturity at around age 15, though it can occur earlier. Different cultures consider this event in different ways. Most individuals take on apprenticeship or schooling to prepare them for adulthood or to train for their chosen future job. Others enroll in the military, and a few choose to undergo a coming of age ceremony in a remote and dangerous area. During this adolescent period of life, social restraints are relaxed, unlike childhood, and the young people are allowed more personal freedom.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 4 (Flowers)

A flower is a part of a plant which contains thigs like petals, sepals, stamen and ovules.

I have been told that there are many different kinds of teenagers. Some teenagers like to party, others like to study hard and still others just want to chill out. The teenager that I'm most familiar with is one who would rather play a video game, get on the computer or spend time with friends. Hours can go by and I won't even see him unless it's time to eat dinner. I have noticed, however, that once a week (and usually on the weekend) he will quietly close himself off to do his homework. He is not a bad student, but I just don't understand him!

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Adrenalins)

Rage is a physiological response that occurs when adrenaline levels rise. The body releases epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine into the blood stream to increase heart rate, breathing and respiration rates. Rage typically occurs when a perceived threat is imminent, and evokes a strong emotional response to fend off the threat. It has been proposed that rage evolved during humans' early development. Aggression is a vital survival instinct during battle and rage would provide the energy and aggression to overpower a threat.

Tyrannosaurus rex was the largest carnivorous dinosaur that ever lived. The name Tyrannosaurus comes from T-R-U-N-S, meaning "the king" in Latin. It has been given its official name by the paleontologist, Dr Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905. Reaching about 13 metres in length, 7 metres in height, and a maximum weight of 7 tonnes, T.rex is also one of the most recognizable dinosaurs. Thanks to its movie appearance (King Kong, Jurassic Park, Walking with Dinosaurs) and media profile, the name "Tyrannosaurus rex" is known worldwide.

The body of Tyrannosaurus is so well distributed that it gives the animals an enormous strength. The head houses a small but strong neck.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Adulthoods)

Puberty: At puberty, male and female tigers reach sexual maturity at different ages. The average age of first mating is between 13 and 15 years for males and 11 to 12 years for females. Females are polyestrous, so may go in and out of heat several times within a year. Females rarely attract male tigers before the age of 3-4 years, when they first come into heat. While females can attract male tigers immediately after their first estrus, it is uncommon for them to mate until their second or third heat. This times the mating so the cubs are born the next winter, which leads to closely spaced pregnancies. Since she gives birth only once a year in the winter, all of her adult life is spent raising her offspring.

Efforts have been made to develop artificial intelligence (AI), including autonomous weapons systems, that can perform tasks previously performed by humans. The first such system was developed by Raytheon Company in the 1960s. The most well-known example of AI is the fictional HAL 9000, which is the main feature of Arthur C. Clark's Space Odyssey saga. The existence of true AI is still a matter of debate among the scientific community.
Other scientific fields that have seen major developments include genetic engineering, in vitro fertilisation, cloning, and stem cell research. There has also been extensive development of more advanced forms of medication, including painkillers and antibiotics. In terms of transportation, the hovercraft has been developed, as well as the first human-piloted spaceship.

Water is a polar inorganic compound that forms a liquid, and it is essential for all known forms of life. Water in all of its forms, with the notable exceptions of supercritical water and some water-containing vegetables such as water chestnuts, contains hydrogen covalently bonded to oxygen. Water is an excellent solvent due to its polarity;each individual molecule can attach to many other molecules. Most importantly, water is vital for life, both as the solvent in which many nutrients dissolve and as an essential resource for life itself.

As technology advances at a faster and faster pace, what new things can we expect over the next three decades? Today, we will discuss the thirty most amazing advances that we will see between now and 2046.

Fishing vessels have advantages over other types of ships in that they can operate at greater depths, move more quickly and maneuver better while navigating waters with currents and waves. A lifeboat has many functions, but is generally designed to maneuver safely and comfortably at sea so it can go look for help or safety for the people aboard. It carries navigational equipment so that it can find its way to safety. Boats are usually distinguished fromships, because boats are typically smaller, they have lower freeboards and use sails for propulsion. They also usually lack the rigidity and block structure of larger ships, relying instead on stronger wood or fiber to contain the flexibility of their hulls.

Lone wolves are individuals who have made it alone through life without any need for companionship. They tend to live independently from other people, preferring solitude and isolation. The term "loner" can be more broadly applied to anyone who lives apart from society and refuses to mingle, but that is not its strict definition. Most loners however are content with their solitude and would not appreciate being bothered. Others may enjoy the company of other people intermittently. Despite this, there are loners who still prefer to keep to themselves most or all of the time.

However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Adversaries)

Habitat: The world's largest land carnivores, tigers occupy an area of approximately 10 million square kilometres (3.5 million sq mi), making them the second-largest land predator after humans. They now are found in the wild only in a few places in South and East Asia, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. In 2016, an estimated 3,200 tigers existed in the wild, including mating couples, whereas about 500 remain in captivity.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Adversities)

Ecosystem disruption, such as overfishing or climate change, can have severe effects on marine life. The loss of fish stocks has been linked to a decline in food supply for humans and other animals. In this way, overfishing can acts as a barrier to economic development. For example, it has been estimated that the REDD+ problem results in economic losses of €7 billion per year for Senegal. Many governments are increasingly implementing fishing quotas and bans in an attempt to alleviate these issues. Marine pollution (toxic chemical dumping, oil spills, industrial waste, sewage etc.) has been linked to the death of plants and animals in the marine ecosystem, including mass deaths of fish and birds.

By sharing knowledge and advice that you have gained through your own life experiences, you can offer useful knowledge to others.

Such things are the province of investigative and administrative bodies, which may be separate for each jurisdiction.

But they are also at a disadvantage compared with others on the ground. They cannot run or jump as well as an infantryman or a parachutist, they cannot hide behind obstacles like a tank, they cannot shoot directly below themselves like a self-propelled gun or a bomber, and they can be blinded by

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Aerosols)

Methane is a colorless, flammable gas that occurs naturally in the atmosphere and can be released through natural processes such as wildfires. The main source of methane emissions comes from human activities. In the past, wetlands were a major source, but due to land development practices and reduction in precipitation, natural emissions from wetlands are much lower than they once were. Direct emissions occur from enteric fermentation by ruminants (cows, sheep etc.), as well as through the process of petroleum production and distribution, coal mining, the generation of electricity and landfills. Landfill emissions can be reduced in several ways. Methane can be burned off, but the technology required is expensive.

If you are referring to marital problems, I would advise you to see a marriage guidance counsellor or seek private counselling elsewhere. If it is an employment issue, then look for another job. Finally, if you are literally referring to another person sharing your bed, I would suggest professional help.

The use of the word affairs in this manner does not make sense in the context of an official letter of this nature.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 1 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Affairs)

Gentlemen, I have been told that you are here to take me to my husband. My name is Mary Lou, and I am your prisoner today. It is my wish that we will all be safe, and I thank you for this, at least. However, I wish to place one caveat upon your protection. I am travelling to join my husband who is on the opposite side in this conflict. I do not intend this to become a war-time issue and will not speak of it or act in any way to encourage my husband in any way.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Affectations)

Narcissism is a psychological disorder characterized by excessive self-love and admiration. The word originated from Greek mythology, where the young hunter Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. He ultimately died as a result of his ill-fated love, but that did not diminish the popularity of the term nowadays. There are many types of narcissism, such as social and sexual. This disorder is regarded as one of the most severe mental conditions.

You were given a second chance, and this is when you began life in the village that would come to know you as Cole.
Your second affront was when you were sixteen, while out with the hunting party. A fierce snowstorm brewed unexpectedly, catching everyone unawares.

Citizens of the world have been living under a constant state of war ever since man first began to settle down on land. These wars involved everything; from minor arguments over land or resources to religious differences, major power struggles and everything in between. From the very second humans began to interact with each other, it was seconds away from a civil war. For a while, humans continued to live as nomads, constantly traveling across the Earth in search of food, water and other resources. This allowed them to fight and settle their problems on the move, as they would soon have to find a new place to settle down anyway.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Aftershaves)

Dandruff shampoo was invented in 1883 by Dr. William Dandridge of New York City. He wanted to make a cure for "dandruff and all other scurfy diseases." He combined tar, resorcin, mercuric chloride and oxygenated water. In 1897, Dr. Penfold, of England, created the first modern-day shampoo. It wasn't until the 1920s that companies started to market shampoos for hair care. With the invention of mass media, advertisers began to create "beauty myths," where they link certain products with a flawless appearance. This led to companies creating shampoos and conditioners to repair damage done to the hair by various methods of grooming.

Numerous studies have been conducted into the effects of aging on humans, and there is no consensus among scientists regarding any particular conclusion. However, many researchers believe that human life spans will continue to increase through natural selection. The following is a list of the recognized ages lived by humans, from newest to oldest:

Conception - Age 0

Baby - Age 1 (0-1)
modern age 1 - 30
modern age 31 - 75
modern age 75 - Today (76+)
modern age (today onwards) +x
modern age +x (expected human life span at x)

Aging, also known as senescence, is the irreversible functional deterioration of the organism, developing as the stage of life in which an adult slowly weakens and dies.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 1 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called boats.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Agencies)

Keenly aware of its place within society, the law enforcement agencies of the world have developed several methods to deal with crime and disorder. Agencies range from multi-national instruments of government, such as the Global Drug Enforcement Agency, to local community groups, such as the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance. The size and approach of agencies varies depending on the priorities and needs of every society, ranging from armed police forces who may fight both regular crime and act during riots, to agents snooping for the smallest misdemeanors within subway trains. Whenever possible, different law enforcement groups will attempt to cooperate with each other so as to have a unified response to crime.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 4 (Scales)

A scale is an instrument used for measuring weight.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Agendas)

Groups of people have agendas that may not necessarily coincide with those of the group itself. These agendas can be selfish, altruistic or even neutral. They might be based upon personal gain, power struggles or ideological differences.

6. Answer the following question in one sentence: The main idea of the third paragraph can be defined as "Tigers prefer to live alone, unless they are female and have cubs". Agree or disagree? Give a reason for your answer.

Paragraph 3 says that female tigers form social units, but males do not. I disagree with this statement and believe that males do form social units. I base this opinion on my own experience. In primary school, there was a boy who was extremely lonely, unpopular and always picked on.

His most well-known work is book of prophecies, 'Les Propheties', which consists of over a 1,000 vague and abstract prophecies intended to help the future. Due to the manner of writing and some of the contents, many people at that time thought he was a sorcerer and some still believe this. However, many people consider him to have been a genius of that period.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Aggressions)

Loss of life can occur when one animal attacks another in defense or aggression. Aggression between animals occurs both within and outside of captivity. In zoos and wildlife parks, animal attacks may occur due to human error. For instance, a monkey pulls a door off its hinges to explore the area. In another scenario, a keeper leaves a gate to the yard open. In 2013, an orangutan named Jimmy reportedly killed a supervisor at the Cleveland zoo after she disrupted his routine by entering his enclosure.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Aggressors)

Killing is defined as the act of killing someone else, either directly or indirectly. Aggression can take many forms, from a simple verbal threat to an attack that results in injury or death. However, the defining element is that the act of aggression is interpersonally unjust and unacceptable and that there exists an equal or greater retaliation or response that prevents the initial act from progressing. It is often assumed that violent aggression has natural incentives within human behaviour. However, there is debate over the extent that such behaviour is natural and Darwinian Evolution has been used to defend both sides.

There are many kinds of aggression, and factors can differ based on the aggressor and the victim. However, there are some kinds of aggressions that researchers have consistently applied to their studies.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Agnostics)

Clergy who do not believe in God are known as agnostics. The word atheist comes from the Greek words "agnos" meaning without God and "theism," which means belief in a deity. Agnosticism comes from the Greek word "gnosis", meaning knowledge. Hence, the words atheist and agnostic were created from philosophical rather than scientific roots.

Agnostics typically claim that the existence of God, as well as the non-existence of God, is not provable. There are three types of agnostics: weak, strong and negative. Weak agnostics claim it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of God. They may believe in God, but since proving it cannot be done, they do not profess complete belief.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Agonies)

Tears are fluid secretions from the lacrimal gland that protect the eye against drying out. They form when mucus accumulates within the lacrimal glands, blocking drainage and causing them to swell up. Specialized sensory neurons in the eyes then detect this dampness on the eye and send signals to the brain that provoke an emotional response to this sensation. This is then interpreted by a person as an unpleasant experience. Once the brain registers this response the body's receptors, shaped to interpret such signals and other bodily sensations as suffering or agitation, send signals to the lacrimal gland to produce more tears. These physical symptoms are often interpreted as an unpleasant experience.

Fully automatic weapons are firearms that fire a cartridge by means of a rotating bolt rather than by pressure from the muzzle. These include machine guns, anti-materiel rifles and other similar types of weapon. Semi-automatic firearms, which require one trigger pull for each shot but automatically reload, were more developed when the seminal firearms that led to the invention of the automatic rifle had been invented. This class includes assault rifles and pistols.
The first firearms were 2013s, early flintlocks (ca. 1500s), matchlock muskets (ca. 1500s) and Wheelock pistols (1700s). By the invention of the semi-automatic loading mechanism in guns, rifles were vastly more economical in terms of manpower and military resources.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Ailments)

Rheumatic fever is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes inflammation of blood vessels and tissues throughout the body. It can affect any part of the body, but it affects joints most commonly. The inflammation that this disease causes mainly occurs in the vascular endothelium, which are the cells that line the inner muscle layer of blood vessels. Inflammation can cause changes in these cells so that they react more easily to irritation. This can allow white blood cells to pass from the circulatory system into the blood vessel walls and other tissues.

However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called @boats@.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Aims)

I am not sure what you mean by 'aiming'. I would assume that your question refers to the type of weapon used, which in turn could refer to the weapons employed. The earliest weapons used were in fact natural or man-made weapons, depending on who you consider to be the first to do it. They were generally sharpened rocks or clubs and in some cases even teeth and claws. The next advancement was the invention of the arrow and spear. The bow was later perfected to increase range and power of these weapons. Swords were first invented in Asia around 3000 BC and quickly spread to Europe.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airs)

Numerous airships have been constructed throughout history, although none have reached any great height. The first airship was built in China around the year 1000 AD and flew for only six months. The first chemical reaction engines were invented in the 1780s, leading to the first flights at the beginning of the 19th century, with the first manned flight occurring in France in 1783. During the 20th century, airships proposed several ambitious designs that could potentially fly around the globe. Although airships never became common transportation vehicles, they are still used for surveillance and military purposes in the 21st century.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 4 (Canals)

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airs)

Elements of air include gases, liquids and solids that can be described as being composed mainly of one atom each. Air is not physically present unless combined with other elements. Many ancient cultures believed air to be an element, along side the traditional four of fire, water, earth and metal. Let's look at air. Air, like fire, is invisible and difficult to grasp. Air appears solid at a high altitude, because the air there is very thin. Air always dissolves into water and rarely becomes frozen. Except in mountains, air floats over all substances.

Rockets are rockets that have been filled with liquid propellant rather than solid fuel. They can be launched from aircraft, land vehicles, submarines and space launch facilities. Liquid-propelled rockets have been around for hundreds of years, but truly practical liquid-propelled rockets were successfully developed in the 1950s, withorbiting NASA satellites starting in 1957. Liquid-propelled rockets exceed the velocities that can be achieved with solid propellant rockets, and their higher thrust allows larger payloads and varying mission profiles.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airs)

Loud noises can cause air currents that affect weather patterns and climate. Airflows can also change the composition of the atmosphere, changing atmospheric pressure. Changes in wind speed and direction influence winds and precipitation levels. Air pressure is the force that one square foot of the atmosphere exerts on another and is measured in pounds per square foot. The atmosphere consists of multiple layers. Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.033% carbon dioxide, and smaller amounts of other gases. Air pressure can be measured using an aneroid barometer, which only measures the weight of the column of air above it.

UFO sightings have been reported throughout history, from the ancient Egyptians to the present day. The first recorded sighting was in 1784 by French astronomer Jean Baptiste Perrin who saw a strange light moving slowly across the sky. Sightings of UFOs also include those of nuclear missile sites by guards as well as reports from military pilots, and have involved politicians as well as the general public. Many of the most well-known UFO reports occurred near military bases and involved government property, such as Roswell, but these are not the only reports that have been made.

Landsat 8 image of the Indian Ocean shows a broad area of blue sky with scattered clouds and several faint cirrus clouds in the foreground. The air temperature at this location on December 7, 2013 was -2°C (-23°F). Although the sky appears blue, any picture of the sky from lenses or films actually shows all wavelengths, not just the blue ones. Clouds are white because they are made of water droplets which randomly reflect all wavelengths without absorbing them.

Airplanes are aircraft made from metal, usually of wood or composite materials like plastic. They are powered by gas turbines or jet engines, and can carry people or freight. All regular airplanes have four key parts: the fuselage, the wings, the tail and the landing gear. Airplanes fall into two categories: seaplanes, which can land on water, and regular planes, which can only land on a runway. These requirements affect their design and how they are used.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airbags)

Mortality rates from airbag related injuries have decreased dramatically since the introduction of the first generation of airbags in vehicles manufactured after 2000. Airbag inflators can rupture if punctured, causing severe internal injury and even death. Children under the age of 13 are at a greater risk of death from an airbag injury as their brain boxes and chest bodies are not fully developed. Additionally, studies have shown that death rates are higher if the person is not wearing a seat belt. The deployment of the airbag can cause serious neck and facial injuries if the seat belt is not being worn when it is triggered.

It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called @boats@.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airlifts)

Meltdown: The sudden loss of control over a spacecraft during launch.

Readers' Comments: This is not a good example because it contains a lot of technical jargon that readers may find difficult to understand.

You are advised to seek clarification.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airlines)

Pilots flying commercial aircraft are required to have a Commercial Pilot Certificate (CPC), or equivalent, issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has established certain minimum standards that all pilots must meet in order to obtain this certificate. These standards include undergoing a drug test, a background check, and must be at least 18 years old. Other criteria include pupil-pilots, specific medical requirements, and tests involving aerodynamics and a sample flight with an examiner.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airliners)

Pilots flying aircraft are those who fly them. They can be classified into three groups: pilots, flight engineers and navigators. Pilots pilot aircraft; flight engineers design, fabricate and maintain the aircraft; navigators provide navigation assistance. In the military, pilots are armed.

Aircraft can fly in a number of ways:

Drawn: A horse-drawn team and wagon may be used to provide lift .

. Bicycle: Airships may be tethered: Short baskets may be suspended with a captive balloon. Ungrounded free balloons degrade quickly in even minor breeze and are susceptible to disease .

. Airship: The airship is one of humanity's great achievements. Airships require a great deal of resources and energy to produce but are capable of self-powered flight, are self-sufficient on resources and travel at rapid speeds.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airmails)

Cargo ships are vessels that transport goods between ports, usually by sea. The term 'airmail' refers to mail sent from one country to another via air. The first cargo ships in the world were made of reeds and were used in Sumer, thousands of years ago. The Romans made the first large cargo ships from reed and wood. The main cargo ships today are made of metal.
In the past, much like airmail, cargo ships traveled by sails and were pushed by wind power. Today, however, they are powered by steam engines or motor engines. Sailing ships are still sometimes used.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Airmen)

Pilots, Airmen, Marines and Sailors are all aircrew members who perform duties related to flight operations and aircraft operation. They may also be referred to as pilots, aviators or aviation personnel. A pilot controls the aircraft, a role that requires a great deal of training, but no technical experience. Airmen operate various systems within the aircraft; a role that is relatively free of responsibility, but which requires technical understanding. Marines provide armed security and protection against both internal and external threats and play a key role in boarding enemy ships. Sailors perform all other tasks required on the aircraft, such as mechnical, medical and intelligence.

A plane is a self-propelled aircraft designed to travel through the air at high speed. Planes are commonly used for transportation purposes, although some planes have been modified for military use. The term "plane" is used to differentiate a craft from a helicopter, which is usually heavier and only travels through the air with the help of an engine powered rotor. Planes have at least one wing to produce lift. In common usage, planes are also commonly referred to as "helicopters", although this is technically inaccurate.

Pilots have been using airports since the 1930s, when the first one was built at New York City's LaGuardia Airport. Today there are more than 4,500 airports worldwide serving a population of over 7 billion people. A major airport, such as Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) in Georgia or London Heathrow (LHR) in England, serves several million people each year. There are over 50 major airports in the United States alone. Each year, over 700 million people use US airports. Large airports can maintain their own police forces, security personnel, and other safety resources separate from local law enforcement agencies.

Lunars are space vehicles that have been designed to operate in low gravity environments. They include spacecraft capable of operating at altitudes of up to 100 kilometers above Earth's surface, including those used for scientific research. They are used in several industries including space science, telecommunications, as well as the growing space tourism industry. Outer space is a natural environment for humans. Between the Earth and its atmosphere, there is a zone of rarefied gases and solar wind known as the "thermosphere". At the top of thermosphere, solar energy accelerates subatomic particles that constantly bombard humans with radiation.

Our government has wanted to go into Iraq for a long time but until this year the UK and the UN were opposed to the idea. Did you not watch news reports when the bombing happened? The Government said that Iraq was hiding weapons and that their leader was responsible for 11 September. Well, most of the people I know don't believe that, if you had questions then you wouldn't be watching too much TV. In fact since the bombing happened we've seen more media coverage.

Mammals have five toes on each foot; reptiles four toes on each foot; birds three toes on each foot; fish two toes on each foot. All other vertebrates lack digits, and instead possess claws. Apart from the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, mammals are the only surviving group of vertebrates to develop digits. All types of vertebrate animals have muscles that allow them to lengthen and contract. These muscles develop from the walls of blood vessels and resemble long strands of cables. Unlike tendons, these muscles are able to stretch, which allows animals to reach out and grab prey.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alans)

Ulaan Baatar was the former capital of Mongolia until it was abandoned during the collapse of the Mongol Empire in 12th century. The city has been rebuilt several times since then, and remains one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Eurasia. The current capital of Mongolia is the city of Ulaanbaatar (Ulan Bator). It had a population of roughly 1,380,000 (2008), which holds the majority of possession of modern Mongolia. The city begins with a large open air market which Simon briefly browses. Although he doesn't get anything, he enjoys watching the wide variety of people. The city is influenced by many different cultures and people, being a crossroads of history. For examples, west of the city is where the so-called wild west Mongolia begins and, even beyond that, the Tibetan Plateau.

Governing a province of a million people is extremely challenging and takes considerable time.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alarms)

Citizens of the United States of America have been known to employ various devices to protect themselves from potential dangers. The most common type of alarm is a bell that sounds when it is activated. This can be through a trigger such as opening a window or door, or motion. The bell sounds and alerts anyone inside the house to the potential break-in, giving them time to prepare or hide. Other alarms use electricity and sound a very loud noise when activated. In modern times, these are used in hotels and banks to alert the presence of a thief.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Albinos)

Racial characteristics vary among different subspecies of Albinism, but all individuals have at least one white gene that causes them to lack pigment in certain parts of the body. This results in pale skin, hairlessness and bluish eyes. Other common traits involve deafness, nystagmus and poor vision. Melanin is an important part of the human eye that prevents blindness due to its ability to absorb light. Without it, light can enter the pupil, and reflect off the retina, potentially damaging it.

There are many factors that may contribute to a higher occurrence of Albinism in specific areas. Animals, including humans, adjust their phenotype and gene expression in reaction to their environment.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 1 (Tigers)

The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 2 (Boats)

A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship. Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called @boats@.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alcohols)

Cannabis is the name given to a group of related plants that contain the psychoactive chemical Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The plant Cannabis sativa L. specifically denotes the medical form of the plant, cultivated for production of THC (which is also found in much smaller quantities in its relative, industrial hemp). The term cannabis is also used more generally to denote the essential oils, extracts, psychoactive drugs and varying intoxicants produced from the whole plant, various portions of it (almost always excluding the fiber portion, i.e. the bast fibers and hurds) and synthetic variants and analogues of different chemical classes.

Physiology Paragraph 1 (Seeing)

Vision is the process of visual perception.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alcoholics)

Eating too much alcohol can cause physical changes that lead to mental deterioration. Alcoholics may develop an inability to control their urges and become violent or even suicidal. A person who drinks excessively may also experience memory loss, confusion, hallucinations and other symptoms. Some alcoholics may withdraw from society altogether, while others develop an inability to form relationships with other people.

Long-term alcohol abuse can also take a serious toll on a person's physical appearance and personal hygiene. Loss of energy and malnutrition often result in long-term alcoholics, who may die prematurely from the effects of alcoholism.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alcoholisms)

I am not sure what you mean by alcoholism, but I can assure you that it does not include drinking beer or wine with dinner. So I'd say that it was a myth that people with alcoholism pass out on the floor and soak their clothes in puke.

That sounds like it is describing my little sister after she's had too much candy. Anyway...

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alcoves)

Oddly, there are no known examples of a human building an enclosure large enough to house all the animals that would fit inside it.
Its otherness is found in a different way. While it's obviously a work of humans, the intent behind this is not clear. Was the original purpose of the building to house rare animals? If so, why would they go to such great lengths to do so? What could have motivated the creation of this or similar sites in the past? Perhaps after millennia of erosion the original purpose has been lost, but it remains a fascinating possibility. One thing to be considered is that the site has been recently ravaged by treasure hunters. Perhaps an original record or clue can be found among the scattered archeological evidence, though it may just as likely be lost among the decay and damage of time.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Ales)

Spirits of alcohol are a type of liquid produced from yeast fermentation. They are commonly used in beverages such as beer, wine and mead. Some spirits are distilled, resulting in a product with high alcohol content, commonly called liquor. So that the word "alcohol" is not misunderstood as meaning all drinks with ethanol in them, the word "spirits" is used to separate distilled alcohol from the rest.

A distilled beverage is liquor which contains ethanol, water, and at times some artificial ingredients. These only include beverages which are prepared using the distillation process.The term can also refer to the alcoholic solutions that are used in the preparation of such beverages.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alerts)

Fully automatic weapons fire bullets that can pierce armor and cause death from multiple wounds. Semi-automatic rifles are similar, except they also have a pump action mechanism to load more ammunition into the weapon. Handguns are small firearms that can be held in one hand and are designed to be used at much shorter range. Shotguns fire small metal pieces called shotgun shells filled with hundreds of small lead or steel pellets. Much greater than a rifle cartridge. They are often used for hunting and sometimes in combat to spread a wall of lead.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 4 (Houses)

Homes are a place of people's private residence. They are generally distinguished from larger buildings in that they are divided into separate units where people can live independently.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alexanders)

Famous British astronomer Sir John Herschel was born in 1685, and died in 1727. He is best known for his work on planetary motion, but he also made important contributions to astronomy during the Age of Enlightenment. For example, he and his sister both catalogued the stars and star clusters in the Milky Way, and his sister even classified them according to the colors of their spectra. Today, these clusters are still known as the Herschels.

The best-known astronomical work of Herschel is his cataloging of the extensive collection of William Herschel of double stars. These important observations included details of their position, distance from each other and the angle between them.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Algebras)

Fluorescent algae, also known as algal fluorescences, are greenish-yellow to red in colour and have been used since ancient times for medicinal purposes. They contain substances that help prevent infection from bacteria and viruses. The word "algebra" stems from the Arabic term al-jabr, a mathematical formula for solving quadratic equations that was developed by Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī.
modern scientists generally conclude that there exists some form of complex chemistry within plants and other living things.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Aliases)

Habitat: The Aliases are the name given to various animals that share similar characteristics, such as the tiger and the horse. These animals have a few distinguishing facial traits (such as whiskers), but are easily capable of passing on the others. Most of these animals have started out with this program due to the fact that they are extremely endangered or no longer exist. Take for example the Ancistrus Fish. This extinct fish, which clearly had many similarities to the catfish family, was wiped out due to its ineffective attempts to use camouflage to protect itself.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alibis)

Killing someone while impersonating another person is not necessarily illegal. There have been cases where it has been used as a way to avoid detection. Most often it is used in the commission of another criminal activity where a suspect can claim that somebody else was present at the scene of the crime. It is not a way to avoid punishment altogether as law enforcement agencies attempt to prove that the suspect in question was, in fact, the one who committed the crime.

The most notable use of an alibi is arguably by the American criminal Lizzie Borden who was accused and later acquitted of murdering her father and stepmother with an axe in Fall River, Massachusetts, 1892.

By 2268, the two sides had forged a significant peace and eventually became allies against a greater threat. By 2287 the Terran Empire had collapsed, while the Klingons had begun pursuing a more benevolent path.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Alimonies)

Habitat: The alimony tree is a shrub or small tree that grows on rocky slopes in arid environments, where it provides shelter from the sun during hot summer months. The tree is rather weak and only stands about 5 feet tall and falls over with only the slightest breeze. The plant does not photosynthesise, instead it feeds on alimony. The roots are in the form of flexible tentacles which absorb alimony that seeps down from above.

In addition to light, water and nutrients the Alimony Tree also requires a continuous flow of alimony. If individuals do not support the tree with their alimony payments the tree will slowly die as the tentacles shrivel up and cease to absorb any nutrients.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Allegiances)

Sailing ships, merchant vessels and fishing boats all have common characteristics that distinguish them from other types of craft. Such characteristics focus on loading and launching (tide and wind dependent), cargo volumes, crew sizes and more. However, many of these same vessels may also be used in ways that do not match such classifications. For example, during the American Civil War, an armed Union supply ship was converted to a warship and used to capture blockade runners. Once captured, they were metamorphosed back into cargo vessels by the Union. Such changes in functioning were not isolated; rather they formed part of a larger strategy aimed at countering a challenger and its abilities.

Etymology: Alias: tales, legends; from Latin tales, legends.

Literary works that have been told orally for generations and are considered to be myths or fables. They usually involve a world of humans, gods, goddesses, heroes and semi-divine beings struggling between good and evil. Notable examples include the Indian Panchatantra and the Arabian Indian One Thousand and One Nights. Even in written forms they are usually anonymous, presumably to add to the mystique that surrounds them.

They are similar to parables, except parables are anecdotes about real people (or animals) rather than mythological ones.

Lupus erythematosus (Lyme disease), also known as "bull's fever", is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It is very common in many parts of the word. An experimental vaccine for humans is undergoing Phase 2 testing. The disease was first discovered in the late 1800s in Southern Germany by a physician. After the skin illness with flu-like symptoms, no drugs have been found to cure lupus. Molecular anti-bodies are used to treat this disease.

Gangways should also be easy to keep clean and free of clutter or trash. They are common in urban areas, and also on boats and ships. The term is also commonly applied to various related types of vertical connections between decks within a ship.

Reading Comprehension Paragraph 3 (Allocations)

Nuclear weapons have been used to devastating effect in war since World War II. There has been a movement advocating for the destruction of these weapons as they have no other use than to cause mass destruction and do not contribute to the preservation of peace.

The amount of money it would cost to destroy these weapons would be better spent on allocating resources towards more pressing matters such as poverty eradication and conflict resolution in the developing world.

Opinions vary greatly on this topic between people of influence such as politicians and general members of the public.

Mixed-race people have been known to live and work together peacefully in many parts of the world.

Some had their own slaves, as did the family of George Washington, our first president. Still, there were people with prejudices that saw darker-skinned people as an inferior type. Later the indentured servants became slaves for life, and many mixed-race children born to them lost their freedom.

Prayer is one of the oldest human practices and has been practised throughout recorded history. The earliest known prayer books date from at least 40,000 BC.

Some people pray to a single god that they believe created reality. Others pray to multiple gods or deities that, together, they believe create reality. Still others conceptualise reality as a self-existent entity that does not require the concept of a "creator". Some people pray to no god or deity. Prayer may take a variety of forms from spontaneous offering of thoughts to a deity, deity's representatives or spiritual forces to articulate requests made to a deity to express gratitude or acknowledge a favour.
