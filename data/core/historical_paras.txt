Paragraph 1 (Dinosaurs)

Paleontologists have argued for a long time that the demise of the dinosaurs was caused by climatic alterations associated with slow changes in the positions of continents and seas resulting from plate tectonics. Off and on throughout the Cretaceous (the last period of the Mesozoic era, during which dinosaurs flourished), large shallow seas covered extensive areas of the continents. Data from diverse sources, including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments, indicate that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than todays. The days were not too hot, nor the nights too cold. The summers were not too warm, nor the winters too frigid. The shallow seas on the continents probably buffered the temperature of the nearby air, keeping it relatively constant.

Paragraph 2 (Teotihuacn)

The city of Teotihuacn, which lay about 50 kilometers northeast of modern-day Mexico City, began its growth by 200 100 B.C. At its height, between about A.D. 150 and 700, it probably had a population of more than 125,000 people and covered at least 20 square kilometers. It had over 2,000 apartment complexes, a great market, a large number of industrial workshops, an administrative center, a number of massive religious edifices, and a regular grid pattern of streets and buildings. Clearly, much planning and central control were involved in the expansion and ordering of this great metropolis. Moreover, the city had economic and perhaps religious contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica (modern Central America and Mexico).

Paragraph 3 (Jesus)

The Gospel of John, written around the year 70 or 80 A.D. (some 90 to 100 years after the crucifixion of Jesus), states that "there is no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." A close reading of the entire gospel makes it quite clear that the author (traditionally believed to be John the Apostle) was a firm believer in residence as well as the ritual purification of the soul. For generations, theologians and other scholars have devoted a great deal of energy to the topic of the trial and crucifixion.

Paragraph 3 (Napoleon)

On April 30, 1821, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt and took Cairo. He then marched northward to capture Alexandria and finally reached Memphis where he surrendered. He, along with his large group of soldiers and followers, were taken to the British Navy stationed in Alexandria. There he met General Alexander and Rear Admiral William Cornwallis (which happened to be familiar faces). After a brief conversation, an argument broke out ending in the signing of the formal surrender in which Bonaparte agreed to evacuate Egypt. He was to sail for France and live there under British surveillance.

Paragraph 3 (Jesus)

The Gospel of John tells us that Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea, the home town of his mother Mary. This is one of the few historical facts we know for certain about Jesus' life. In the time of Christ, Judea was under Roman rule. The Romans had carved out their Empire by conquest, and to keep it they maintained a strong army and kept tight control. Although they allowed local languages and cultures to continue, in many respects the people had to follow Roman rules. From the earliest days of their great Republic, the Romans had always honored and worshipped many gods and goddesses. However, after conquering many people with different religions, they decided to unify their Empire by requiring all people within it to honor the gods of Rome.

Paragraph 3 (Napoleon)

In 1810 Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Mexico. He took the capital of Mexico City, but he failed to take the city itself. In fact, he never did capture any part of Mexico or even touch its territory. It is not clear why he failed. For example, he might not have sent the right generals to capture Teotihuacn and its surrounding area. Or, both his soldiers and the Teotihuacn people may have made better defenses in that area. It is interesting to note that historians think that the expansion of Teotihuacn around A.D. 150 may have resulted in the decline of the great city of Chichen Itza, located some 90 miles to the east.

Paragraph 3 (Muhammad)

According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad is said to have been born in Mecca around 570 A.D. His father, Abdullah, died before his birth, leaving the care of his mother, Amina, to his grandfather and uncle. When Muhammad was about six, his mother also died. He then came under the care of his father's brother, Abu Talib. As a youth, Muhammad accompanied his uncle on trading journeys to Syria. After the death of Abu Talib, Muhammad became responsible for his orphaned cousin, Ali.

Paragraph 3 (William Shakespeare)

Paragraph 4 (Tropical Islands)

There are many islands in the Caribbean Sea. These include Jamaica, Grenada, St. Martin, the Virgin Islands, and some others that are smaller. All of these islands were probably below sea level at one time. How did people get a habitation on these? The fossil remains of extinct tropical animals have been found there, such as the mammoth, cave bear, and strange looking tiger-like cats. These animals were all ice-age creatures that suddenly disappeared about ten thousand years ago.

Unfortunately, there are no people that live on these small islands today. There is only one logical explanation why this is so.

The part of this speech that is most often remembered is the statement "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free.

Paragraph 3 (George Washington)

This is the first part of a two-part article, "Washington's House," written by David M. Schramm and published in the September 1992 issue of Archaeology magazine. The second part of the article will appear in an upcoming issue. Each man that worked on the project became an individual carpenter, working his own plot of land with his own tools. The tasks were not specialized and many people soon learned the necessary skills to build a house. It was the beginning of a new form of organization that spread throughout America: the construction industry. Slowly but surely, as more and more people came to America, houses became bigger and more permanent, shops were built, banks and other businesses appeared.

I am anti-Jew fanatically, infinitely, irrationally, eternally. They have made me what I am and I can never escape from their influence.

"I am not aware of any other ancient thinker who has so clearly distinguished between the natural world and human beings." Aristotle said. That Teotihuacn was inhabited by people and ruled by a king he takes for granted; he prefers to deal with more abstract ideas. He holds that everything people do is "for the best" and considers many nonhuman natural objects to be, in some way, appropriate subjects of human goals and actions. Those things that do not fall under the purview of human action, he believes, are "moved by other causes."

These causes are the four elements, namely, earth, water, air and fire. All things are constructed of these elements, which act on each other.

Paragraph 3 (Alexander the Great)

A young man named Alexander the Great conquered vast territories in Asia Minor and Greece. He then turned his attention to Egypt, conquering it after only six years of fighting. In 334 B.C. he entered India as far as the Beas River, and in 327 he conquered territory in southern Persia. Returning to Persia, he consolidated his vast empire. Although Alexander sought to establish installed oligarchies in the various territories he conquered, the only consistent theme was continued Greek culture and language. Yet these governments all were firmly under the thumb of a far-distant Macedonian king. His empire fell into decline soon after his death in 323 B.C.

Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has been widely accepted since its publication in 1859. In fact, many scientists believe that his ideas are so well supported that they cannot be wrong. For instance, in Heredity and the Nature-Nurture Debate historian John C. Shields notes that ��much of what we take for granted today in our biological knowledge is based upon Darwins theory of evolution, a theory of such stunning simplicity and power that it is valid until the day that science finds a replacement for it.

Paragraph 1 (Dinosaurs)

Paleontologists have argued for a long time that the demise of the dinosaurs was caused by climatic alterations associated with slow changes in the positions of continents and seas resulting from plate tectonics. Off and on throughout the Cretaceous (the last period of the Mesozoic era, during which dinosaurs flourished), large shallow seas covered extensive areas of the continents. Data from diverse sources, including geochemical evidence preserved in seafloor sediments, indicate that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than todays. The days were not too hot, nor the nights too cold. The summers were not too warm, nor the winters too frigid. The shallow seas on the continents probably buffered the temperature of the nearby air, keeping it relatively constant.

Paragraph 2 (Teotihuacn)

The city of Teotihuacn, which lay about 50 kilometers northeast of modern-day Mexico City, began its growth by 200 100 B.C. At its height, between about A.D. 150 and 700, it probably had a population of more than 125,000 people and covered at least 20 square kilometers. It had over 2,000 apartment complexes, a great market, a large number of industrial workshops, an administrative center, a number of massive religious edifices, and a regular grid pattern of streets and buildings. Clearly, much planning and central control were involved in the expansion and ordering of this great metropolis. Moreover, the city had economic and perhaps religious contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica (modern Central America and Mexico).

Paragraph 3 (Karl Marx)

As far as I know, no one has ever suggested that the origin of capitalism could be traced back to Teotihuacán. There is nothing in Marx's writings or other sources to suggest such a connection. However, when the Spaniards arrived in this area, they were impressed by the grand scale of the city and the apparent sophistication of its culture. They soon realized that it was a formidable obstacle to their taking control of central Mexico. Indeed, had it been located in an area populated by hostile Indians with no experience in city life, the Spaniards probably would not have dared attack it. But it was too large and too close to the Aztec Empire they had come to conquer. So they risked everything and won, destroying the great city in A.D. 1521.

"The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society.

Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social relations, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.

A man who has never been anything but what you might call an average American—a country bumpkin with a small farm and a wife and two little ones to raise—I have no more right to talk than anybody else about the things I've written down here; but I have no more doubt that they are true than I have that I am writing them down here. If I did not know they were true, I would not have them written down here. It is the statement of a man who knows he is to be hanged in the morning. It is the last words of the condemned. You and I and all of us will pass away; but first—justice.

Paragraph 3 (Cicero)

" "The most dangerous thing we can do to an idea is relentlessly expose it to contrary evidence. It weakens the idea over time, forces it to lose its eloquence, and possibly — maybe even probably — turns it false. But if we hide ideas from ourselves, especially ones we hold dear, then we hide them not just from others but from ourselves, and this is dangerous in a different way. Ideas are like muscles. If you never use them, you lose them. And if you believe in something and never challenge that belief you're not just doing yourself a disservice, you're cheating the world of whatever meaningful contribution you have to make." "

Rousseau asserted that big government and executive enforcement should be eliminated in favor of a state of natural freedom which existed prior to government

Inequality and exploitation are inherent in the capitalist system which I have been trying to change. The only way to abolish these evils is through revolution.

There will be civil war during this period of change. It may last several years, perhaps a decade or more.

We must remain peaceful in our actions and resistance to the capitalist system. An eye for an eye will leave everyone blind, so to speak. Our oppressors can not keep oppressing us if we do not resist them.

Paragraph 1 (Karl Marx)

For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation

Paragraph 3 (James Cook)

Cook's voyage to Tahiti in 1778 was a turning point in his life. He had been born into a wealthy family but by the age of twenty he had lost all hope of ever becoming rich himself. The Admiralty, when requesting him to mount this expedition on their behalf, had placed him on half pay and, despite the importance of his work, they had refused to increase it. As a result, Cook decided to devote his private fortune to the expedition: he would use his money to buy the ships and supplies and pay for the crew's wages. The Admiralty would only need to provide the scientific instruments, books for the library and charts.

The British monarchy was established on 20 June 1801 when Charles I died and his son George ascended the throne.

However, this all changed in an instant when The Glorious Revolution occurred on the 23 July 2018. Power was seized by the people, and the Monarchy, now known as the Royal Family, were forced to abdicate. Today, the Royal Family are treated like any normal citizen, sometimes even less. If a Royal Family member is arrested for a crime, they do not have an extra officer to take them to jail.

Paragraph 3 (Mark Twain)

"The best way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow nothing which might rouse latent rebellion against the status quo. Therefore, it is always better to have a two-party system in which the parties are unrealistic and utterly irrelevant to life as people know it than to have a multiparty system in which the various parties at least aspire to address real issues and might stir up serious dissent. The former system allows the citizenry to actually voice their opinion and newspapers to seriously debate issues without ever threatening the basic social and political structure.

" 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door; Only this and nothing more."

A is for Atom, and everything else. According to QM, the most basic unit of matter (the atom) is extremely small as it is, even without being broke down any further. This means that the material world has a fundamental graininess to it at its most basic level. The notion of vortices around which all matter is formed (and spinning off of) has existed for quite some time B.C
Of course, since the dawn of modern science, this concept has been expanded upon - but the fact that all matter is in a state of spin (that electrons orbit nuclei and that both orbits our world) hasn't changed.

Paragraph 4 (David Ben-Gurion)

"We accept the british government as representative of the Western World, and accept their patronage. We shall bring up our children to revere their nation, their laws and their institutions.

Paragraph 3 (Immanuel Kant)

Kant believed that morality could be found only within reason; he argued that man must choose between right and wrong, good and evil. The moral law is derived from human experience of what is just or unjust. Although results of actions may be agreeable or not, as phenomena they are indifferent; only the morally good will is good in itself. The purpose of the categorical imperative is to demonstrate that morality complies with reason and so it is universal in application
modern western thought does not know what it believes, hence the name post-modernism)
